    "Q1-What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax Errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 1:-\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that exceptions occur during program execution while syntax errors occur during the compilation of the program. Syntax errors are caught by the interpreter before the program is executed, while exceptions are caught during the execution of the program. Syntax errors are typically caused by mistakes in the code, while exceptions are caused by unexpected events or conditions that occur during program execution. Additionally, syntax errors can be corrected by fixing the code, while exceptions must be handled by the programmer using exception handling techniques."
