    "Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode\n",
    "of file opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 1:-In Python, the built-in open() function is used to open a file. The open() function takes two arguments, the filename and the mode of opening the file.\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file in Python are:\n",
    "r (read mode): This mode is used to read the contents of an existing file. If the file does not exist, it will raise a FileNotFoundError exception.\n",
    "w (write mode): This mode is used to create a new file or overwrite the contents of an existing file. If the file does not exist, it will be created. If the file already exists, its contents will be truncated to zero length before writing begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "a (append mode): This mode is used to append new content to an existing file. If the file does not exist, it will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "x (exclusive creation mode): This mode is used to create a new file but raises a FileExistsError exception if the file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "b (binary mode): This mode is used to read or write binary data, such as images, audio files, or binary text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "t (text mode): This mode is used to read or write text data, such as plain text files. This is the default mode if no mode is specified.\n",

    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer 2:-\n",
    "The close() function is used to close an opened file in Python. It is important to close a file after reading from it or writing to it, as it releases any system resources, such as memory or file descriptors, that were being used by the file. If a file is not closed, it can cause problems, such as data corruption or errors when trying to access the file later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some reasons why it is important to close a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource management: When a file is opened, it consumes system resources such as memory and file descriptors. If a file is not closed, those resources will be held open, leading to issues such as memory leaks and the inability to open new files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data integrity: If data is written to a file but the file is not closed properly, the data may not be fully written to the file. This can lead to corrupted data or data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "File locks: If a file is not closed properly, it may still be locked by the operating system, preventing other processes or threads from accessing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that a file is properly closed after it is used, it is recommended to use the with statement when opening the file. The with statement ensures that the file is automatically closed when the block of code inside it finishes executing, even if an exception occurs. "
